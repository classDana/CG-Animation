# Forest Adventure Animation
This project is a group effort developed as part of our university coursework. Our goal was to leverage JavaScript to craft an engaging and dynamic animation that showcases our programming skills and creativity.

## Content
The content of the animation is a character which explores a mysterious forest with a flashlight and at the end of his journey he discovers a hidden treasure.

## Features
- ### Dynamic Animation:
  Watch as our custom-made character navigates through the forest environment, with smooth animations and transitions.
- ### Interactive Elements:
  Users can control the character's movements and flashlight using simple keyboard inputs, enhancing the immersive experience.
- #### Visual Effects:
  Experience the ambiance of the forest with carefully crafted visuals, including shadow effects, foliage, and atmospheric lighting.
- ### Special Effects:
  We've incorporated special effects to enhance the overall experience. One notable feature is the minimap, which provides users with a bird's-eye view of the forest layout, aiding in navigation and adding an extra layer of depth to the animation.
- ### Treasure Hunt:
Follow along as the character embarks on a journey, uncovering clues and ultimately stumbling upon a hidden treasure at the end of the adventure.
